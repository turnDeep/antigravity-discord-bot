# Relay

This folder contains the thin WebSocket relay used by the default hosted Windodex pairing flow.

In production, the default hosted relay runs on my VPS. If you want, you can inspect this code, fork it, and host the same relay yourself.

## What It Does

- accepts WebSocket connections at `/relay/{sessionId}`
- pairs one Mac host with one live iPhone client for a session
- forwards secure control messages and encrypted payloads between Mac and iPhone
- logs only connection metadata and payload sizes, not plaintext prompts or responses
- exposes lightweight stats for a health endpoint

## What It Does Not Do

- it does not run Codex
- it does not execute git commands
- it does not contain your repository checkout
- it does not persist the local workspace on the server

Codex, git, and local file operations still run on the user's Mac.
The relay is intentionally blind to Windodex application contents once the secure handshake completes.

## Security Model

Windodex uses the relay as a transport hop, not as a trusted application server.

- The pairing QR gives the iPhone the bridge identity public key plus short-lived session details.
- The iPhone and bridge perform a signed handshake, derive shared AES-256-GCM keys with X25519 + HKDF-SHA256, and then encrypt application payloads end to end.
- The relay can still observe connection metadata and the plaintext secure control messages needed to establish the encrypted session.
- The relay does not receive plaintext Windodex application payloads after the secure session is active.

## Protocol Notes

- path: `/relay/{sessionId}`
- required header: `x-role: mac` or `x-role: iphone`
- close code `4000`: invalid session or role
- close code `4001`: previous Mac connection replaced
- close code `4002`: session unavailable / Mac disconnected
- close code `4003`: previous iPhone connection replaced

## Usage

`relay.js` exports:

- `setupRelay(wss)`
- `getRelayStats()`

It is meant to be attached to a `ws` `WebSocketServer` from your own HTTP server.
